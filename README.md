# VueJsDemoProject

This is my first project with Vue.js

It is a web app that simulates a company's internal control system which keeps track of products and clients.

## Running the app

After cloning the repo, you need to open two terminal windows for running the backend and the frontend, respectively.
In order to run the backend, go to the project folder and, in the terminal, switch to the server-side folder:

        cd server-side

Next, run the server with:

        npm start

In order to run the frontend, go back to the project folder and switch to the client-side folder:

        cd client-side
        
Finally, run the frontend:

        npm run serve

Done!

After all these steps, you should be facing a login page in your `localhost:8080` (or another port).
Sign in with the admin credentials:

    email: admin@admin.com
    password: admin

Now you should have access to the app's functionalities, which are basic CRUD operations for products and clients!
